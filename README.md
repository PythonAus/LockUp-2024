HOW IT WORKS....

1. IF ANY USB CABLE (USB, USB-C) IS PLUGGED INTO YOUR ANDROID A PASSWORD MUST BE ENTERED CORRECTLY (TWICE)
OR IT WILL FORMAT

2. WHEN YOU REMOVE THE CABLE THE PASSWORD MUST BE ENETERED AGAIN.
  
3. IF THE USB CABLE IS PULLED OUT WITHOUT ENTERING THE PASSWORD THE PHONE WILL FORMAT.

4. IF THE PASSWORD PROMPT IS CANCELLED OR DISCARDED THE PHONE WILL FORMAT.
  
5. ENTER YOUR LOCKIT PASSWORD ON YOUR NORMAL LOCK SCREEN AND YOUR PHONE WILL FORMAT.

Plausible Deniability Password: Install a password that will format your phone directly from the lock screen when entered. This password can be as short as one character. This feature is particularly useful when you need to hand over your phone to authorities; you can provide them with this deniability password instead of your real one, and they will inadvertently format your device.
