## NOTE
**THE PASSWORD PROMPT FOR LOCKUP WILL NOT BE SHOWN ON YOUR NORMAL USER LOCK SCREEN. ITS THERE BUT HIDDEN**

**IF A USB CONNECTION IS MADE WHILE YOUR USER-SCREEN IS LOCKED, YOU SHOULD UNLOCK YOUR DEVICE WITHIN 10 SECONDS TO ENTER THE LOCKIT PASSWORD, OR YOUR PHONE WILL FORMAT.**

**JUST CHARGING YOUR DEVICE WILL NOT START THE PROCESS, AND NO PASSWORD PROMPT WILL BE REQUESTED.**

**FOR YOUR NORMAL EVERYDAY USER LOCK SCREEN, YOU MUST USE A PASSWORD-BASED SCREEN LOCK, NO PASSCODES OR SWIPE STYLE, IN ORDER FOR LOCKIT TO WORK.**

---

## HOW IT WORKS...

1. **IF ANY USB CABLE (USB, USB-C) IS PLUGGED INTO YOUR ANDROID, A PASSWORD MUST BE ENTERED CORRECTLY (TWICE) OR IT WILL FORMAT.**

2. **WHEN YOU REMOVE THE CABLE, THE PASSWORD MUST BE ENTERED AGAIN.**
  
3. **IF THE USB CABLE IS PULLED OUT WITHOUT ENTERING THE PASSWORD, THE PHONE WILL FORMAT.**

4. **IF THE PASSWORD PROMPT IS CANCELED OR DISCARDED, THE PHONE WILL FORMAT.**
  
5. **ENTER YOUR LOCKIT PASSWORD ON YOUR NORMAL LOCK SCREEN, AND YOUR PHONE WILL FORMAT.**

### Plausible Deniability Password
Use the password on your actual 'real' lock screen and your phone will format. This password can be as short as one character. 
---

This feature is particularly useful when you need to hand over your phone to authorities; you can provide them with this deniability password instead of your real one, and they will inadvertently format your device.

This app design was initially uploaded by Matt Bergin with partial code completion so criminals could not use it. I hope criminals do use it.

### Requirements
- Device administrator must be enabled.
- Accessibility service must be enabled.
- Use a character-based password for your existing lock screen.

### Compatibility
Tested with Android 13 and Android 14 using API 30.
